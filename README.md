==========

Informal requirements for DjangoCon 2014 web site

### Understand the types of site visitors:

* Attendees (registered and potential)

* Speakers

  Most speaker needs are handled by Symposion functionality, which could perhaps
  most easily be integrated as a seperate domain to avoid undue constraints on
  other parts of the site.

* Sprinters

  Need to know dates, places, who's sprinting on what.
  
  Should be able to volunteer easily.

* Sponsors

  Should be able to sign up from the web and manage their sponsorship. We have
  made a number of Symposion improvements in this area we would like to see
  merged into the main Symposion repo maintained by Cacktus.

* Volunteers

  Should be able to see information about roles available.
  
  Should be able to sign up from the site without creating an account.

* Post-event visitors

  Should be able to easily locate talk videos and slides
  
  Should be able to access information about 2015's upcoming conferences.

### Understand the dynamic nature of the site, and how these state changes might impact the needs of visitors.

### Pre-conference (long-term and near-term)

This is the approximate timeline for significant changes to the site as the conference draws near.

### During the conference

### Post-conference

See the needs of post-event site visitors above.


### What worked in the past and what didnâ€™t?

For example: was the roomsharing wiki effective?

### List of goals for the site

We plan to use all of the above as a design brief that enables the IA, UX and visual design processes.


Additional questions:

Is there a formal DjangoCon style guide, or anything akin to brand guidelines?

  No - in the past Idan Gazit has designed the logo, but this is not a requirement

  Any use of the Django logo should get approval from the DSF

Would the visual design work for the website include creating a conference logo and branding for 2014?

  Yes, even if we wanted an Idan logo he most likely wouldn't have time to design a whole site.
